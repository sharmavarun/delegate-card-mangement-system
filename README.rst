A Delegate Card Management System
---------------------------------
* Wrote it as a replacement to our college's old technical and cultural fest delegate card management system.
* Its simple to implement, generic system.
* Logo and images can be replaced by replacing the old images with new images of same name.
* The end user of this software is the help desk/registration volunteer who has the autority to add new teams to the event.
* Participants can apply for events only after joining/creating a team.
* A participant can be a part of multiple teams but if all the team members are already a part of a team, then new team won't be created and end user will be prompted to use the existing team number.
* For every delegate card entry a unique delegate no. is generated by the system and this delegate card number/numbers are used to create a team.
* The list of all the participant with team numbers and delegate numbers is available on home page of every event.
